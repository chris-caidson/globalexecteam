              Carol Elizabeth of Burlington, Ontario was named our 2017 Heart of Isagenix winner for her continuous energy and her ability
              to inspire those around her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have never met anyone who can fill me up with so much love and motivation, and Carol does this for everyone effortlessly,”
              said Associate Ginna Larson. “She has a huge heart of service and a powerful vision of raising women up to
              live to their fullest potential.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Carol’s passion for helping others to be the best they can be is contagious, and Isagenix was so honored to recognize her
              for this incredible achievement at last year’s NYKO.
