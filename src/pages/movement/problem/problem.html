          <span class="title">Fed Up</span> focuses on the OVERUSE OF SUGAR in our food supply by showing how the first dietary guidelines issued
          by the U.S. government 30 years ago overlooked the role of dietary sugar in increasing risks of obesity, diabetes,
          and its associated ill-health outcomes, particularly in children.</p>

        <h1 class="uppercase">The Unhealthy Truth</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="title">The Unhealthy Truth</span> is a call to action that shows how each of us can do our part and keep our own families
          safe. Author Robyn O’Brien turns to accredited research conducted in Europe that confirms the toxicity of America’s
          food supply, and investigates the relationship between Big Food and Big Money that has ensured that the United
          States is one of the only developed countries in the world to allow hidden toxins in our food—toxins that are increasingly
          being blamed for the alarming recent increases in allergies, A.D.H.D., cancer, and asthma among our children.
