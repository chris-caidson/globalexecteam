          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="testimonial">“An entire 30 days of your food is covered with the Ultimate Pak, along with treats, samples, a blender, and
              the potential to create a lucrative extra stream of income. Share the Ultimate Pak with your new enrollees
              today and get on the fast-track to explosive business success! We just retired from our previous, 9-to-5 professional
              careers and we owe it in part to the Ultimate Pak.”</span> – Pam B
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="testimonial">“It’s a ‘Business in a Box.’ Included with the 30-Day Cleansing and Fat Burning System, IsaLean® Bars, IsaDelight
              Plus™, Want More Energy?® Sticks, SlimCakes® and IsaBlender® are three, 5-Piece Sample Paks you can share!
              Since these ‘shareable’ paks help you build your business, they could be considered a tax write-off (just be
              sure to double-check with your tax consultant).”</span> – Ted B.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="testimonial">“The Ultimate Pak includes products that help people stick around longer because they love them so much, your
              team members who join with a Ultimate Pak are more likely to commit to an Isagenix lifestyle and even consider
              creating a business, too. A person who enrolls with a Ultimate Pak is more likely to enroll others compared
              to those who join with just a 30-Day System.”</span> – Carolyne R.
