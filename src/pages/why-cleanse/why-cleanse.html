              <h2>Why Cleanse?</h2>
              <h3>One of the biggest threats to our health is our own environment.</h3>
              <p>Our nutritionally bankrupt food overladen with empty calories, combined with an ever-increasing toxic world,
                is wreaking havoc on our mental and physical health.</p>
              <p>In addition to an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, many scientists now question if the toxic overload may
                also be contributing to weight gain, obesity and accelerated aging. Everyone-even people who are fit and
                lean – needs to know how a nutritionally-bankrupt yet empty calorie-rich diet, and overexposure to toxins
                can affect their long-term health.
              </p>
              <p>While no one product can single-handedly remedy all of our problems, it’s imperative that we get serious about
                improving and maintaining our health through a system that provides nutritional cleansing, replenishing of
                nutrient and support for healthy aging.</p>

              <h3>How Cleansing Helps You Live Long and Live Healthy</h3>
              <p>Isagenix is not simply a juice cleanse or a detox cleanse. Those are temporary fixes that don’t solve the bigger
                problem of keeping our bodies free of harmful toxins. The Isagenix cleanses are a long-term solution that
                lead to a greater sense of vitality, improved metabolism, and help burn the unhealthy, visceral fat stored
                in bodies. You’re also going to improve your body’s natural cellular cleansing system, something that a simple
                liver cleanse won’t take care of.</p>
              <h3>Don't Be Surprised if You Experience Some of the Following During Your Cleanse:</h3>
              <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>A boost of energy in your day to day activities.</li>
                <li>Less craving for fatty, chemical ridden food.</li>
                <li>Lean, improved muscle tone.</li>
                <li>Steady and predictable weight loss over time.</li>
                <li>Balanced and consistent digestion.</li>
