          <h3>FAQ's</h3>
          <h4>What makes IsaLean Shakes unique?</h4>
          <p>IsaLean Shakes contain superior nutrition compared to other meal replacement shakes on the market. IsaLean Shakes
            contain exclusively sourced Myo-IsaLean Complex, the highest-quality whey protein from cows that are not treated
            with hormones or routine antibiotics. IsaLean Shakes also contain Ionic Alfalfa™—our proprietary alfalfa juice
            concentrate enriched in ionic minerals to keep the body running at peak performance.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Why are IsaLean Shakes so important for the body?
          </h4>
          <p>
            IsaLean Shakes provide balanced nutrients to maximize nutrition while minimizing caloric intake for safe weight loss and
            effective weight management. Our exclusive shakes also have added enzymes to break down the carbohydrates, proteins
            and fats for maximum absorption of key nutrients.
          </p>
          <h4>How do IsaLean Shakes support Nutritional Cleansing?</h4>
          <p>Protein is an important nutrient needed by everyone on a daily basis. It is made up of essential and non-essential
            amino acids, which are the “building blocks” for healthy bodies. Our high quality whey protein concentrate contains
            a superior amino acid profile for optimum health and wellness. Protein has a number of different roles in the
            body including the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Repair body cells</li>
            <li>Build and repair muscles and bones</li>
            <li>Provide a source of energy</li>
            <li>Curb cravings</li>
            <li>Control many of the important processes in the body related to metabolism</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What can I add to my IsaLean Shakes?</h4>
          <p>
            Our delicious shakes are perfect enjoyed just as they are. However, they are also extremely versatile and can be mixed with
            other great Isagenix products. For extra nutrition, add a scoop of IsaFruits®, Isagenix Greens!™, Want More Energy?®,
            IsaPro, Isagenix FiberPro™ or a half of an Oatmeal Berry SlimCake. You can add fresh fruit to your shake. See
            your Independent Associate for recipes.
