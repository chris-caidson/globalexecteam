          <h3>FAQ's</h3>
          <h4>
            How do I use Cleanse for Life?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Cleanse for Life should be used as part of an Isagenix Cleansing and Fat Burning System for either daily cleansing or deep
            cleansing. Drink 1 scoop of powder dissolved in 4 oz of water, or one 2 oz bottle of Cleanse for Life, up to
            twice daily. Enjoy warm or cold. For a deeper, one- or two-day cleanse, drink 2 scoops of powder dissolved in
            4 oz of water, or two, 2 oz bottles of Cleanse for Life, up to four times throughout the day. Enjoy warm or cold.
            Cleansing is most effective with a combination of both daily and deep cleanses. Refer to the Cleansing & Fat
            Burning Guide for further guidance.
          </p>
          <h4>
            How does Cleanse for Life work?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Cleanse for Life is not a colon cleanse or laxative. It is different because it nourishes the liver and promotes whole-body
            cleansing on a cellular level. And, unlike other products on the market that may deplete the body of vital nutrients,
            Cleanse for Life actually nourishes the body as it cleanses, gently removing contaminants from your body’s tissues,
            promoting weight loss.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What are the differences between liquid and the powder?
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Cleanse for Life Liquid and the Cleanse for Life Powder equally provide nutritional cleansing benefits with the main
            variation being delivery form—liquid versus powder. With Cleanse for Life conveniently available in two forms,
            it is perfect for a variety of busy lifestyles. The liquid is already blended, so there is no mixing needed.
            Alternatively, the Cleanse for Life Powder is portable; you can take the powder with you and mix it with water
            whenever you want. Both taste great.</p>
