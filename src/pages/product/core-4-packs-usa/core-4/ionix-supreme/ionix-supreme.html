            <span class="testimonial">“Ionix® Supreme is one of my all time favorite products! Why? It gives me incredible energy…not a coffee like
              energy but a clean burning energy. I call it my JET FUEL! Also when I am over tired I take an ounce or so of
              Ionix® Supreme liquid and I can feel my whole body relax and get ready for a great night’s sleep. We all know
              we can’t rejuvenate well without a solid 8 hours sleep. Ionix® Supreme helps me sleep like a baby. Which is
              something I struggled with for 30 yrs. I LOVE the Ionix® Supreme. What a gift!”</span> – She-She K., Arizona

            *
          </p>
          <h4>What are Adaptogens and why are they important?</h4>
          <p>
            Adaptogenic ingredients derived from plants help neutralize the effects of stress and power performance. Long-term stress
            may contribute to health conditions, such as high blood pressure, chronic anxiety and digestive issues.

          <h4>How should I take Ionix Supreme?</h4>
          <p>To receive optimum benefits from Ionix Supreme we encourage that you take 1–2 ounces per day. The key is to listen
            to your body—it will often tell you when something is working positively for you. You may start off conservatively
            by taking ½–1 teaspoon a day and work up from there. By taking Ionix Supreme every day, you may enjoy long-term
            adaptogenic, anti-stress, and body-balancing benefits.</p>
