          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="testimonial">“I began taking IsaGenesis (Product B) in September 2010. The changes are both visible and invisible, but the biggest change
              is that I’ve lost all semblance of my age. If it weren’t for my driver’s license, I’d feel like I was 25. I
              have more energy, and every day I feel more and more alive. I went skiing with Associate Kirk M. and didn’t
              feel sore afterward.”</span>
