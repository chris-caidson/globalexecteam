      <h2 class="centered">Susan Shares Her Three-Year Retirement Plan</h2>
      <section>
        <h3 class="uppercase">Congratulations, Isagenix Millionaires No. 144, Susan and Murray Miller!</h3>
        <p>
          Over the last <a href="//isafyi.com/three-year-retirement-plan/" target="_blank">three years</a>, Susan has built a million-dollar business with Isagenix. But more importantly—at least to her—is
          that her team members are replicating her success, and in some cases building even faster than she is!
        </p>
        <img id="susan_01" src="../../../assets/imgs/millionaires/small/susan.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Susan was incredibly successful with her previous company, but was reluctant to come out of her decade-and-a-half
          retirement to rejoin the network marketing industry. She was previously with another direct sales company, where
          it had become clear to her that her team wasn’t succeeding like she was. And because of this particular company’s
          compensation plan, they probably never would.</p>
        <p> “When you make it about levels, you are forcing people to become salespeople to meet the stringent requirements that
          allow you to get paid on the lowest levels of your team,” says Susan. “Innately there is something very wrong with
          that. So I walked away from the industry for 15 years.”</p>
        <h3>Coming Back</h3>
        <p>
          “I loved when I was in the industry, because it draws in people that see the cup half full instead of half empty. You’re
          surrounding yourself with some of the most amazing people. But I didn’t believe there was a way of changing the
          business model, I just assumed it was broken.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That all changed for Susan in 2012, when Isagenix Co-Founder and Executive Vice President Kathy Coover explained the Isagenix
          compensation plan. “It was so simple, they removed the levels. If you want to make a difference in your life physically
          and financially, this company gives you that opportunity. You’re never building a business on the backs of your
          family and friends. Everyone is buying the product at wholesale and everyone has the same business opportunity
          as you do.”
        </p>
        <h3>A System for Success</h3>
        <p>Susan believes this is a business that takes at least six to ten hours a week of consistent effort, day in and day
          out. While you only get out as much as you put in, Susan is a firm believer that if you can get through the first
          year and stay consistent, your second year is your reward. And your third year sets you up for financial freedom
          and retirement – her <a href="//isafyi.com/three-year-retirement-plan/" target="_blank">three–year retirement plan.</a></p>
        <img id="susan_02" src="../../../assets/imgs/millionaires/small/the-millers.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Susan uses a four-step system, a baseball diamond. “First base is sifting for interest. Second base is following
          up, including a validation call with a leader. Third base is IsaProduct.com, opening a wholesale account, and product
          education. Home plate is educating people on how to build a business through a proven, duplicable system.</p>
        <p>“If you’re a brand-new person your job is only to get people to first and second base for your first 30 to 60 days.
          Your leaders will help you get them to third base, because they have the expertise but you have a network of people
          they don’t know. And it’s a win-win.”</p>
        <h3>Enjoying Success</h3>

              Susan’s team focuses on a <a href="//isafyi.com/three-year-retirement-plan/" target="_blank">three-year freedom or retirement plan</a>. With three years of focused, dedicated effort, she says,
              “you could be in a position where you could pay off your debt, have positive cash flow that continues even
              after you stop working, which gives you options in life.”
            </p>

              Susan earned a trip to Paris in our $500 Million: Together We Will Challenge and she, along with dozens of her team members
              are working toward a luxurious trip to the French Riviera in our Billion & Beyond: Together We Will Challenge
              this year.
