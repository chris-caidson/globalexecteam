          * An Isagenix Millionaire is an Independent Associate to whom Isagenix has paid a gross total of $1 million
          or more since
          joining Isagenix. Earnings reflect gross amounts that do not include any business expenses. Earning levels or
          income
          statements (including claims such as the ability to quit a job or stay at home or portrayals of luxury
          lifestyles)
          for the Isagenix Independent Associates discussed here exceed the average results achieved by all Associates
          during
          the same time period, are not necessarily representative of the success or compensation that any particular
          Associate
          will receive, and should not be construed as typical or average. The ability to earn income under the
          Isagenix
          Team Compensation Plan depends on many factors including an individual Associateâ€™s business, social, and
          sales
          skills; personal ambition and activity; availability of time and financial resources; and access to a large
          network
          of family, friends, and business contacts. Isagenix cannot and does not guarantee any particular level of
          earnings.
          Even Associates who dedicate a significant amount of time, effort, and personal funds may not achieve a
          meaningful
          level of success. For average earnings of Independent Associates, please refer to the Isagenix Earnings
          Disclosure
          Statement at IsagenixEarnings.com.
