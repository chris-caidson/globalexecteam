          Congratulations, Isagenix Millionaires No. 157, Jessica and Joe Johnston!
        </h3>
        <p>
          “I began my career in investment banking with a huge broker corporation and did really well there,” reflects 39-year-old
          Jessica. “But the job kept me overworked and stressed with the long hours.”

        <p>
          After facing some health challenges, the newly wed decided to quit her job and focus solely on her health, so she and her
          husband could start their family.
        </p>
        <h3>Splashing Around with Isagenix</h3>
        <p>
          One day while at the community pool with her daughters, Jessica found herself talking with her neighbor, Herb.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Herb said, ‘I’d love for you to take a look at Isagenix,’” says Jessica. “He said, ‘Your personality would be great for
          the business.’”
        </p>
        <p>
          After 18 months of going back and forth with Isagenix, Jessica decided to follow her instincts, order the President’s Pak,
          and join the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          After trying the products, she felt invigorated and ended up releasing 12 pounds.*
        </p>
        <h3>The Business of Feeling Good</h3>
        <p>
          Before learning about Isagenix, she and her brother, Adam, a personal training professional, opened an upscale fitness center.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now Adam has released 12 pounds* using the products and is sharing them with most of their clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I came home after two months one day and said, ‘Honey, I think I can make millions of dollars with this company,’” laughs
          this newest Isagenix Millionaire. “He thought I had lost it. He thought I went off the deep end. Joe literally
          looked at me and said, ‘You think you’re going to make millions of dollars selling protein shakes?’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jessica was right!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of her hard work, she recently purchased a luxury SUV, invested in a $100,000 pool for the family, and tripled
          her daughters’ college savings thanks to her Isagenix business. Her next financial hope is retiring her husband.**
        </p>
        <p>
          “I will use these products forever—without a doubt,” says Jessica. “I love the idea that my husband and I can be home with
          our children as they grow up, spending more time as a family. Isagenix has truly been a blessing for us!”

          subjects lost an average of 9 pounds after 30 days on an Isagenix system. The subjects also had a greater level
          of adherence and had more consistent weight loss from week to week compared to subjects on a traditional diet.
