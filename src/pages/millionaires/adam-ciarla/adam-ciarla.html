        <h3 class="uppercase">Congratulations, Isagenix Millionaire* No. 212, Team Ciarla Fitness!</h3>
        <p>
          When Adam was introduced to Isagenix, he was in his 15th year of running and owning two personal training studios offering
          one-on-one and small group training. He had been looking for a product that would complement his clients’ workouts,
          so when he stumbled on the Isagenix products at his sister Jessica’s house, he was excited to find that the products
          were “a match made in heaven” for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jessica had been trying the products for about two weeks before she told anybody she was using them, so at first, she didn’t
          want me to see the Isagenix box when I stopped by her house,” Adam said. “But I was curious, so we went through
          the box together and started reading the labels.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Jessica made Adam a shake with Vanilla IsaPro®, Isagenix Greens™, Isagenix Fruits™, and Ionix® Supreme, and after tasting
          it, he signed up with Isagenix and ordered his first Value Pak. In the following weeks, Adam’s clients noticed
          a change in his appearance and performance and started asking what he was doing.
        </p>
        <h3>A Step in a New Direction</h3>
        <p>
          “My clients were saying, ‘Sign me up. I need to have what you’re using,’” remembered Adam. “So from a business perspective,
          I jumped right in. But also from a product perspective, I knew I had a perfect captured audience of 20 to 25 trainers
          and about 400 clients to try these products and truly give a personal testimonial on how they work.”
        </p>
        <img id="adam_02" src="assets/imgs/millionaires/small/adam-son.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Adam started working with his clients and coaching them through their Isagenix Systems, watching as all kinds of individuals
          lost weight, improved their athletic performance, or reclaimed their energy. He coached stay-at-home moms, executives,
          student athletes, world-class athletes, and people who had never worked out before in their lives, and watched
          all of them reshape their lives in a new positive direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          “After seeing so many people get positive results, and after experiencing success myself, it was very easy to stand behind
          Isagenix,” Adam said. “I wanted to reach as many people as I could and continue changing lives, so I reached out
          to my close friends, Adrienne and Erin. I knew they could help me hit this out of the park.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam couldn’t have been more right, as the two women quickly became important assets to his vision for helping others. After
          introducing them to Isagenix, they adopted the Isagenix lifestyle and began fitting the business into the pockets
          of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Their hard work really helped push my Isagenix position to where it is today,” said Adam.
        </p>
        <h3>A Life-Changing Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          While running his two studios, Adam often worked 95 to 100 hours a week, so as a single father, building a business with
          Isagenix has been life changing when it comes to raising his son.
        </p>
        <img id="adam_03" src="assets/imgs/millionaires/small/adam-son-golfing.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          “The amount of free time I’ve gotten back has been absolutely amazing,” said Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Isagenix opportunity allows him to work from home, and he now has the time to coach soccer and lacrosse games and take
          his son golfing after school.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If I can just give my son the opportunity to have experiences and a healthy life, that’s extremely fulfilling,” Adam expressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam has also used his business as a way to teach his son about money and what it means to set goals and objectives. They
          take calls together, and his son often sits in his office to watch him build his business.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He knows that I’m creating a living by teaching people how to be healthy,” Adam said, “and he agrees that’s pretty cool.
          This opportunity has been such a blessing to my son, and I couldn’t have done it without the incredible drive and
          passion that Adrienne and Erin have shared in this journey and in building this business. I can’t wait to see what
          the three of us can continue to achieve in the future.”
